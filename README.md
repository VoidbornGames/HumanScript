# HumanScript
HumanScript is a simple, English-like programming language designed to be easily readable and writable by humans. It compiles to 32-bit Windows assembly and is then linked into an executable file (.exe). The language aims to abstract away complex syntax while still providing fundamental programming capabilities.
